        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p><strike>Only some can persevere and achieve the American Dream.</strike> <span class="replacement">While the American Dream remains elusive for many, those who persevere can achieve their goals.</span> In Lorraine Hansberry's play <em>A Raisin in the Sun</em>, the Younger family members try to achieve their different interpretations of the American Dream. They all persevere through societal obstacles and mistakes that they make. This is especially true for Walter, an ambitious father, who dreams of becoming a successful business owner and being able to support his family more. He pushes through mistakes he makes as well as societal barriers, never giving up. Beneatha, his sister, like him, breaks through societal barriers and is close to becoming a doctor by the end of the play. She dreams of becoming a doctor and helping other people. <span class="inline-comment">Even Mama</span>, their mother, perseveres through any obstacle thrown her way. In the play, she works hard to make sure that her children are given many opportunities to be able to do whatever they might want. She also dreams of being able to live the rest of her life as a typical grandmother. The mother in Langston Hughes' poem "Mother to Son" is much like this. She describes the importance of perseverance when achieving a goal and tells her son to always try to move forward. <strike>The two mothers, Walter, and Beneatha all demonstrate how never giving up can help realise one's goals.</strike> Through the perseverance of each Younger family member and further emphasized by the metaphor in Hughes' poem, Lorraine Hansberry develops the theme of accomplishing the American Dream.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="teacher-comment">
            Your introduction is quite long - it's almost half a page! While you provide good context, try to be more concise. Get to your thesis statement faster. Also, your opening sentence is too vague and pessimistic. Consider starting with something more engaging that connects to your actual argument about perseverance.
        </div>

        <div class="strength">
            Your thesis statement (the last sentence) is clear and sets up your essay well. You tell the reader exactly what you'll be discussing: how the characters' perseverance helps develop the theme of the American Dream.
        </div>

        <h2>Body Paragraph 1: Walter Lee Younger</h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Walter Lee Younger interprets the American Dream to mean having a good job that has good pay. He goes about trying to do this by attempting to start a liquor store. The young father hopes to be able to support his family better through this business. However, financial barriers restrict him from being able to begin. In order to obtain the large sum of money needed, he looks to Mama for help. After persistent requests and persuading her to give a portion of her insurance money to him, he tries to acquire a liquor license. Then, instead of obtaining the license the formal and more legal way, Walter and his partners use a roundabout method. This ends up losing all of the money Mama gave to Walter due to one of his partners stealing all of the money and running off. Despite having pushed through obstacles up until this point, Walter wants to give up. But, Mama helps guide Walter into continuing on and moving forward. This theme of never giving up, even when times are hard, is also greatly expressed in Langston Hughes' poem "Mother to Son": <span class="inline-comment">"So boy, don't you turn back. / Don't you set down on the steps / 'Cause you finds it's kinder hard. / Don't you fall now— / for I'se still goin', honey / I'se still climbin' "</span> (lines 14-19). Although Walter faces many obstacles and regression towards his goal of attempting to start a liquor store, his never ending perseverance enables him to go after his version of the American Dream.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="strength">
            Great topic sentence! You clearly state what Walter's American Dream means to him. Your paragraph stays focused on this one character, which shows good organization.
        </div>

        <div class="teacher-comment">
            You do a nice job summarizing Walter's story, but you're mostly retelling the plot. Try to dig deeper into <em>why</em> this matters. What does his perseverance <em>teach us</em>? How does his near-failure and recovery actually show us something important about the American Dream? Don't just tell what happens - analyze what it means.
        </div>

        <div class="suggestion">
            The Hughes poem quote is effective here, but explain the connection more clearly. How does the mother's metaphor of climbing stairs relate specifically to Walter's experience? Make that link explicit for your reader.
        </div>

        <h2>Body Paragraph 2: Beneatha Younger</h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Beneatha Younger dreams of becoming a doctor and being able to help others. She believes that the American Dream means being able to have the freedom to be whatever you want. Throughout her life, she is always trying new activities, whether it's horseback riding or learning to play the guitar. Although people might say that she is wasting money or should stick to one thing, she ignores them and just keeps trying to find what she likes. Beneatha deals with sexism and doubt towards her and her dream in the same way, ignoring and blocking out negativeness. Oftentimes, because Beneatha is a girl, her dream of becoming a doctor is not taken seriously. Additionally, people in her own family, like Walter, question why she even wants to become a doctor and have doubts on whether she can actually succeed or not. Her response to this is to keep on going and have her determination guide her as she refuses to give up on accomplishing her goal. In <em>A Raisin in the Sun</em>, Beneatha shows her defiance when she declares, "...George, for one, still thinks that's pretty funny. I couldn't be bothered with that. I am going to be a doctor and everybody around here better understand that!" (Hansberry 50). Through Beneatha's unwavering determination and defiance when it comes to people doubting her, she is able to have the freedom to be whatever she wants and try to achieve her interpretation of the American Dream.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="strength">
            Excellent use of a direct quote from the play! This quote perfectly captures Beneatha's fierce determination. You also do a good job identifying the specific obstacle she faces (sexism) and how she responds to it.
        </div>

        <div class="teacher-comment">
            This paragraph is stronger than your first body paragraph because you're starting to analyze more. You're not just saying <em>what</em> Beneatha does, but connecting it to the larger theme of the American Dream meaning "freedom to be whatever you want." Nice work!
        </div>

        <div class="suggestion">
            You mention her trying various hobbies (horseback riding, guitar) - this is a nice detail, but it feels a bit disconnected from your main point about her medical dreams. Consider either cutting this or explaining more clearly how this exploratory nature relates to her perseverance as a future doctor.
        </div>

        <h2>Body Paragraph 3: Mama (Lena Younger)</h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>By the end of Lorraine Hansberry's play <em>A Raisin in the Sun</em>, Mama has achieved her dream of being able to give her family more freedom, opportunities, and support as they try to achieve their goals. She also successfully accomplishes her interpretation of the American Dream, successfully giving more and better opportunities and lives to the next generations. <span class="inline-comment">Mama and her late husband worked hard to give their children the best lives they could.</span> Mama raised Walter and Beneatha well so that they could have better lives and opportunities than she did. She further gives to the next generations by using her insurance money to buy the family a new home. This new home allows the Younger family to be able to live in a better neighborhood, have more space, more opportunities, give Travis a better education, and live better lives overall. Mama's financial support towards her children is also clearly evident when she says, "Monday morning I want you to take this money and take three thousand dollars and put it in a savings account for Beneatha's medical schooling. The rest you put into a checking account—with your name on it" (Hansberry 107). She tries her best to support Walter in his journey to starting his liquor business by giving him money and teaching him to be a man. Her support towards Beneatha is just as much as she also tries to help pay for some of Beneatha's medical school. Mama's moral support is similar to the moral support the mother in Langston Hughes' poem "Mother to Son," uses, both talking to their children about never giving up: "Well, son, I'll tell you: / Life for me ain't been no crystal chair…But all the time / I'se been a-climbin' on…So boy, don't turn your back…For I'se still goin', honey" (lines 1-18). Ultimately, because Mama's determination, hard work, and perseverance open up numerous opportunities, improves the lives, and supports the generations ahead of her, she accomplishes her understanding of the American Dream.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="strength">
            You use two quotes here - one from the play and one from the Hughes poem - which shows you understand how to support your arguments with textual evidence. The connection between Mama and the mother in Hughes' poem is particularly strong.
        </div>

        <div class="teacher-comment">
            Watch out for repetition! You say "opportunities" four times in this paragraph and use "successfully" twice in the second sentence. Vary your word choice to make your writing more engaging. Also, the phrase "crystal chair" should be "crystal stair" - check your quotes carefully!
        </div>

        <div class="suggestion">
            Your concluding sentence is very long and grammatically awkward ("improves the lives" doesn't match with "Mama's determination"). Try breaking it into two sentences or restructuring it: "Ultimately, Mama's determination, hard work, and perseverance open up numerous opportunities for her children. By improving their lives and supporting the next generation, she accomplishes her understanding of the American Dream."
        </div>

        <h2>Missing: Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="teacher-comment">
            Your essay ends abruptly! You need a conclusion paragraph that wraps up your argument. A good conclusion should:
            <ul>
                <li>Restate your thesis in a fresh way (don't just copy it)</li>
                <li>Briefly summarize how each character demonstrated perseverance</li>
                <li>End with a broader insight: What can readers learn from these characters? Why does this message about perseverance and the American Dream still matter today?</li>
            </ul>
            Without a conclusion, your essay feels incomplete, like you just stopped writing mid-thought.
        </div>

        <h2>Overall Feedback</h2>

        <div class="strength">
            <strong>What You're Doing Well:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Strong thesis statement that clearly previews your argument</li>
                <li>Good organization with separate paragraphs for each character</li>
                <li>Effective use of quotes from both the play and the poem</li>
                <li>Clear topic sentences that introduce each paragraph's focus</li>
                <li>You understand the theme and can identify it across multiple characters</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="suggestion">
            <strong>Areas for Improvement:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Add a conclusion!</strong> This is your most important revision.</li>
                <li><strong>Trim your introduction:</strong> Get to the point faster. Aim for 4-6 sentences max.</li>
                <li><strong>Deepen your analysis:</strong> Move beyond plot summary. Ask yourself "So what?" after each piece of evidence. What does it prove? Why does it matter?</li>
                <li><strong>Vary your vocabulary:</strong> You overuse certain words like "opportunities," "perseverance," and "American Dream." Use a thesaurus to find synonyms.</li>
                <li><strong>Watch for wordiness:</strong> Phrases like "is able to" can usually be cut to just the verb. "She is able to achieve" → "She achieves"</li>
                <li><strong>Proofread carefully:</strong> Check your quotes (crystal stair vs. crystal chair) and watch for grammar issues in long sentences</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="grade-box">
            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p><strong>This is solid B+ work.</strong> You demonstrate a clear understanding of the play and the theme of perseverance. Your essay is well-organized, and you support your points with evidence from the text. To push this into the A range, focus on deeper analysis (not just summarizing what happens, but explaining what it means), add a strong conclusion, and polish your introduction. You're on the right track - keep up the good work!</p>
            <p><strong>Next Steps:</strong> Revise this essay focusing first on adding a conclusion, then trimming your introduction, and finally deepening your analysis in the body paragraphs. I'd be happy to review your revision!</p>
